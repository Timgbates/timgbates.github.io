Uniform Acceleration. 



Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature tied to issues including how we define particles and radiation. Some of the puzzles which have led to this question becoming pervasive include: 
<ul>
<li>Given a uniformly accelerating electromagnetic charge, we compute  nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction force (using LAD)</li>
<li>Equivalence principle paradox; do falling charges radiate? Depending on one's intuition, one can reasonably come to the conclusion that falling charges in a uniform gravitational field do/do not radiate.  </li> 
</ul>
