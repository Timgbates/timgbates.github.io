      <p class="header">Uniform Acceleration</p>
    </div>



<p>
The controversies with the nature of uniform acceleration radiation go back as far as Max Born in 1909. Radiation of a uniformly accelerated has since presented persistent problems in the physics literature. Some of the puzzles which have led to this question becoming pervasive include: 
<ul>
<li>Given a uniformly accelerating electromagnetic charge, we compute  nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction force (using LAD)</li>
<li>Equivalence principle paradox; do falling charges radiate? Depending on one's intuition, one can reasonably come to the conclusion that falling charges in a uniform gravitational field do/do not radiate.  </li> 
</ul>
My Undergraduate thesis was motivated by trying to answer the second question about the equivalence principle for massless scalar fields. The thesis reproduces some of the results from Ren & Weinberg and elaborates on the flow of energy in the case where the source is undergoing uniform acceleration and the observer is inertial.
 The structure of this work being inspired from Pauri & Vallisneri and also the work of Luther Rinehart. After the thesis was concluded, we began to look at an anomaly in the result for computing radiation for Rindler observers.  
 During summer 2022, in order to resolve the questions posed previously we investigated a scalar source source undergoing some acceleration for a class of displaced Rindler observers. This model is inspired and built off of the work of Luther Rinehart which was done for an electromagnetic field. What we found was that for a minimally coupled stress tensor, there is an additional dependence on the radius for the flux over a sphere that falls off at infinity which on the surface indicated a local discrepancy in what the equivalence principle predicts.  However, when we consider a conformally coupled stress tensor (with coupling parameter 1/6 in 4d), we obtain a result independent of the radius. This work is in collaboration with Stephen Fulling, Gerard Kennedy, and Luther Rinehart.
Our current work is in trying to explain the origins of these anomalies and what their physical implications are.
