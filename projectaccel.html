Uniform Acceleration. 


<p>
Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature tied to issues including how we define particles and radiation. Some of the puzzles which have led to this question becoming pervasive include: 
<ul>
<li>Given a uniformly accelerating electromagnetic charge, we compute  nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction force (using LAD)</li>
<li>Equivalence principle paradox; do falling charges radiate? Depending on one's intuition, one can reasonably come to the conclusion that falling charges in a uniform gravitational field do/do not radiate.  </li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>My Undergraduate thesis was motivated by trying to answer the second question about the equivalence principle for massless scalar fields. The thesis reproduces some of the results from Ren & Weinberg and elaborates on the flow of energy in the case where the source is undergoing uniform acceleration and the observer is inertial. 
    <br> The structure of this work being inspired from Pauri & Vallisneri and also the work of Luther Rinehart. After the thesis was concluded, we began to look at an anomaly in the result for computing radiation for Rindler observers.  
    <br>This work which is discussed below was presented in October 2022 at the TXDE conference and is at present unpublished work.
