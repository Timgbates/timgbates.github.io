                        Hi I'm Tim and I'm a second year PhD. student at Rutgers. I like thinking about manifolds of dimensions up to and including 4. 
      More concretely I am interested in knots, knotted surfaces, Heegaard-Floer homology and its consequences. I attended Texas A&M University from 2019 to 2023 
      where I completed a B.S. and M.S. degree in Mathematics with a minor in physics.
