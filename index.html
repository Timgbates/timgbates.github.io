    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>I am a first year PhD. student at Rutgers. Some of my interests include low-dimensional topology<a href="https://medium.com/@Basedmath">,</a> knot theory, topological data analysis, 
      <br> and mathematical physics. 
    
    In particular categorifications of certain classical invariants of knots and links play an increasingly important role in topology such as the various Floer homology theories, Khovanov homology, etc. <br>
  Similarly many phenomenon in "classical" physics also are upgraded into modern theories. Another viewpoint would be to understand "decategorifications" of modern physics phenomenon and their roots in classical physics. </p>
    <h2> Best Manifolds</h2>
        <h2> Best Invariants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Euler Characteristic (especially of the brain): I wrote a short python code for computing the Euler Characteristic of a graph: <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/EulerCharacteristicAlgo-2.pdf">HERE</a></li>
      <br> It computes the graphs's associated clique complex's Euler characteristic via Oliver Knill's discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
    </ul>

  <h2>Topology</h2>
  <p>In topology, I am primarily interested in topological data analysis and low dimensional topology, in particular knots. 
  <h3>Textbook Solutions</h3>
  Here I have some (unrevised) sets of solutions to various textbooks which I am working through.

  <h3>Low Dimensional Topology and Knots</h3>
  <p>
    Studying and classifying manifolds of dimension 3 and 4 has been a challenge that has puzzled topologists for several generations. <br>
    Dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively simple and have lent themselves to classification theorems, while dimensions >4 are also workable thanks to the help of surgery theory. <br>
    Dimensions 3 and 4 however, seem to be just complicated enough to become a difficult problem, but also not large enough to give enough space to use surjery. <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Knots are nice embeddings of the circle in a 3-sphere. Generally, there are two reasons as to why mathematicians study knots. <br>
    First, they are efficient tools for creating and studying 3 and 4 manifolds. Since we consider knots in a 3-sphere, the compliment of a regular neighborhood of a knot or link is a 3-manifold, which may have some interesting topology. <br>
    Slice knots, and concordance groups of knots give useful ways to study 4-manifolds. One can use the existence of slice knots which are topologically slice but not smoothly slice to prove the existence of exotic smooth structures of R4. <br>

    Secondly, knots are interesting in and of themselves. The fundamental problem of knots theory is the following: given two knots, can we distinguish them up to ambient isotopy (being able to tangle or untangle the knot without crossing itself) <br>
    Unsurprisingly, this problem is incredibly difficult. Knot theorists have developed myriads of invariants used to distinguish knots, and up to a certain degree there is a classification.  <br>
    The study of knots has also been applied to the study of DNA/RNA and molecular structures arising in biology and chemistry. Some invariants of knots have famously been dubbed ``quantum invariants'' due to their utility in certain areas of theoretical physics. <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    My personal interest in knots falls into both branches. I am interesting in the various concordance groups, which are nice from both points of view as 1) they are incredibly important in 4-manifold topology, <br>
    2) knots under the connect sum operation famously form a monoid, and does not admit a group structure, but by passing to the concordance equivalence relation, knots under direct sum now form a group, which can be studied, and attempts to study this is still open and a very exciting area of research.

    <h3>Topological Data Analysis</h3>
  Topological data analysis is the use of tools from topology (homology, Morse theory, cohomology, etc) to study and understand geometric features of data. 
  <br> This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04019.pdf">article</a> posted on ArXiv is a great introduction to the field from a data science perspective by Frederic Chazal and Bertrand Michel. 
  <br> There are some great resources for learning about TDA. <a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s48forman.pdf">A User's guide to discrete Morse theory</a> by Robin Forman on computational Morse theory. </p>
  <br> There is also a review article by Yara Skaf and Reinhard Baubenbacher that gives an overview of TDA practices in biomedical work. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  I plan to update this section with links to some codes for TDA algorithms. At present you can find my short code for computating a generalization of the Euler characteristic (in terms of k-cliques) above. 
  <br>
  <br> Currently I am interested in the use of TDA in the field of neuroscience. How can we study topological features of brain networks?
