    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <h2>Uniform Acceleration </h2>
      <p>Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature. There are several paradoxes which arise including the following. 
        <ul>
            <li>Nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet 0 radiation reaction</li>
            <li>Equivalence principle paradox</li>
        </ul>
        For an overview of this area, I recommend reading: Fulton & Rohrlich, Boulware, Pauri & Vallisneri. 
        <br> To become aquainted with the equivalence principle paradox, the papers by Pauri & Vallisneri, Ginzburg (1970), and Fulling & Wilson are great sources. 
        <br> For work on the scalar field, Ren & Weinberg is the best source, others including Fulling & Wilson (in 2d spacetime) also have contributions in the scalar case. 
        <br> Some of my own notes are included below.

  <h2>Topology</h2>
  <h2>Latex resources</h2>
  Like many, I have struggled with making pretty diagrams in Tikz. I include here some diagrams & plots together with the source latex code for compiling these. Feel free to use and edit!
