    <h2>Uniform Acceleration </h2>
      <p>Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature.<br>
         There are several points of debate which arise including but not limited to the following. 
        <ul>
            <li>Nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction</li>
            <li>Equivalence principle paradox (falling charge radiation paradox)</li>
        </ul>
        For an introduction and overview to this area, I recommend reading: Fulton & Rohrlich 1961, Boulware 1980, and Pauri & Vallisneri 1999. 
        <br> For an overview and somewhat of a resolution to the first point, Ginzburg in his textbook gives a clear argument for how to reconcile the two. <br> There is a similar argument made in Fulton & Rohrlich which is in some sense the standard. 
        <br> To become aquainted with the equivalence principle paradox, the papers by Pauri & Vallisneri (1990), Ginzburg (1970), and Fulling & Wilson are great sources. They go through the paradox of the 4 cases of falling & supported charges and observers. 
        <br> For work on the scalar case, Ren & Weinberg is perhaps the best source. Others including Fulling & Wilson (in 2d spacetime), and Higuchi & Matsas, and Kialka et. al. (for Klein Gordon fields) have also written on the scalar case.
        <br> Some of my own notes are included below.

  <h2>Topology</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite branches of math is topology. I am primarily interested in low dimensional topology as well as applications of topology in data science (topological data analysis). <br>
  I plan to update this section with links to some codes for TDA algorithms. At present you can find my short code for computating a generalization of the Euler characteristic (in terms of k-cliques) above. </p>
  <h2>Latex resources</h2>
  Like many, I have struggled with making pretty diagrams in Tikz. I include here some diagrams & plots together with the source latex code for compiling these. Feel free to use and edit! <br>
  The figures I have created are mainly representations of different coordinate systems used in the uniform acceleration research. (include Rindler coordinates and Null coordinates)
