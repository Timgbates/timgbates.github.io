    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>I like math<a href="https://medium.com/@Basedmath">,</a> Especially topology and geometry. I also love their applications to physics and biology.</p>
    <h2> Best Manifolds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Grassmanians</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Best Invariants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Euler Characteristic (especially of the brain): I wrote a short python code for computing the Euler Characteristic of a graph: <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/EulerCharacteristicAlgo-2.pdf">HERE</a></li>
      <br> It computes the graphs's associated clique complex's Euler characteristic via Oliver Knill's discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
    </ul>
  <h1>Research and Projects</h1>
    <h2>Uniform Acceleration </h2>
      <p>Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature.<br>
         There are several points of debate which arise including but not limited to the following. 
        <ul>
            <li>Nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction</li>
            <li>Equivalence principle paradox (falling charge radiation paradox)</li>
        </ul>
        For an introduction and overview to this area, I recommend reading: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491660901056?via%3Dihub">Fulton & Rohrlich 1961</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491680903607">Boulware 1980</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9903052">Pauri & Vallisneri 1999</a>. 
        <br> For an overview and somewhat of a resolution to the first point, Ginzburg in his textbook gives a clear argument for how to reconcile the two. <br> There is a similar argument made in Fulton & Rohrlich which is in some sense the standard. 
        <br> To become aquainted with the equivalence principle paradox, the papers by Pauri & Vallisneri (1990), Ginzburg (1970), and Fulling & Wilson are great sources. They go through the paradox of the 4 cases of falling & supported charges and observers. 
        <br> For work on the scalar case, Ren & Weinberg is perhaps the best source. Others including Fulling & Wilson (in 2d spacetime), and Higuchi & Matsas, and Kialka et. al. (for Klein Gordon fields) have also written on the scalar case.
        <br> Some of my own notes are included below.

  <h2>Topology</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite branches of math is topology. I am primarily interested in topological data analysis and low dimensional topology. 
  <h3>Textbook Solutions</h3>
  Here I have some (unrevised) sets of solutions to various textbooks which I am working through. 
  <ol>
    <li>Elements of Topology by Singh <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/singhsol.pdf">solutions</a> </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Topological Data Analysis</h3>
  Topological data analysis is the use of tools from topology (homology, Morse theory, cohomology, etc) to study and understand geometric features of data. 
  <br> This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04019.pdf">article</a> posted on ArXiv is a great introduction to the field from a data science perspective by Frederic Chazal and Bertrand Michel. 
  <br> There are some great resources for learning about TDA. <a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s48forman.pdf">A User's guide to discrete Morse theory</a> by Robin Forman on computational Morse theory. </p>
  <br> There is also a review article by Yara Skaf and Reinhard Baubenbacher that gives an overview of TDA practices in biomedical work. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  I plan to update this section with links to some codes for TDA algorithms. At present you can find my short code for computating a generalization of the Euler characteristic (in terms of k-cliques) above. 
  <br>
  <br> Currently I am interested in the use of TDA in the field of neuroscience. How can we study topological features of brain networks?
