    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>I like math<a href="https://medium.com/@Basedmath">,</a> Especially topology and geometry. I also love their applications to physics and biology.</p>
    <h2> Best Manifolds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Grassmanians</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Best Invariants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Euler Characteristic (especially of the brain): I wrote a short python code for computing the Euler Characteristic of a graph: <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/EulerCharacteristicAlgo-2.pdf">HERE</a></li>
      <br> It computes the graphs's associated clique complex's Euler characteristic via Oliver Knill's discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
    </ul>

    <h2>Uniform Acceleration </h2>
      <p>Radiation of a uniformly accelerated charge is a persistent problem in the physics literature.<br>
         There are several points of debate which arise including but not limited to the following. 
        <ul>
            <li>Nonzero power radiated predicted by the Larmor formula, yet zero radiation reaction</li>
            <li>Equivalence principle paradox (falling charge radiation paradox)</li>
        </ul>
        For a proper introduction, I recommend reading: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491660901056?via%3Dihub">Fulton & Rohrlich 1961</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003491680903607">Boulware 1980</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9903052">Pauri & Vallisneri 1999</a>.

  <h2>Topology</h2>
  <p>In topology, I am primarily interested in topological data analysis and low dimensional topology, in particular knots. 
  <h3>Textbook Solutions</h3>
  Here I have some (unrevised) sets of solutions to various textbooks which I am working through. 
  <ol>
    <li>Elements of Topology by Singh <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/singhsol.pdf">solutions</a> </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Low Dimensional Topology and Knots</h3>
  <p>
    Studying and classifying manifolds of dimension 3 and 4 has been a challenge that has puzzled topologists for several generations. <br>
    Dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively simple and have lent themselves to classification theorems, while dimensions >4 are also workable thanks to the help of surgery theory. <br>
    Dimensions 3 and 4 however, seem to be just complicated enough to become a difficult problem, but also not large enough to give enough space to use surjery. <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Knots are nice embeddings of the circle in a 3-sphere. Generally, there are two reasons as to why mathematicians study knots. <br>
    First, they are efficient tools for creating and studying 3 and 4 manifolds. Since we consider knots in a 3-sphere, the compliment of a regular neighborhood of a knot or link is a 3-manifold, which may have some interesting topology. <br>
    Slice knots, and concordance groups of knots give useful ways to study 4-manifolds. One can use the existence of slice knots which are topologically slice but not smoothly slice to prove the existence of exotic smooth structures of R4. <br>

    Secondly, knots are interesting in and of themselves. The fundamental problem of knots theory is the following: given two knots, can we distinguish them up to ambient isotopy (being able to tangle or untangle the knot without crossing itself) <br>
    Unsurprisingly, this problem is incredibly difficult. Knot theorists have developed myriads of invariants used to distinguish knots, and up to a certain degree there is a classification.  <br>
    The study of knots has also been applied to the study of DNA/RNA and molecular structures arising in biology and chemistry. Some invariants of knots have famously been dubbed ``quantum invariants'' due to their utility in certain areas of theoretical physics. <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    My personal interest in knots falls into both branches. I am interesting in the various concordance groups, which are nice from both points of view as 1) they are incredibly important in 4-manifold topology, <br>
    2) knots under the connect sum operation famously form a monoid, and does not admit a group structure, but by passing to the concordance equivalence relation, knots under direct sum now form a group, which can be studied, and attempts to study this is still open and a very exciting area of research. 
  </p>
    <h3>Topological Data Analysis</h3>
  Topological data analysis is the use of tools from topology (homology, Morse theory, cohomology, etc) to study and understand geometric features of data. 
  <br> This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04019.pdf">article</a> posted on ArXiv is a great introduction to the field from a data science perspective by Frederic Chazal and Bertrand Michel. 
  <br> There are some great resources for learning about TDA. <a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s48forman.pdf">A User's guide to discrete Morse theory</a> by Robin Forman on computational Morse theory. </p>
  <br> There is also a review article by Yara Skaf and Reinhard Baubenbacher that gives an overview of TDA practices in biomedical work. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  I plan to update this section with links to some codes for TDA algorithms. At present you can find my short code for computating a generalization of the Euler characteristic (in terms of k-cliques) above. 
  <br>
  <br> Currently I am interested in the use of TDA in the field of neuroscience. How can we study topological features of brain networks?
