    <h2 text-align: center;> About Me </h2>
    <p style="color:white;">I am a first year PhD. student at Rutgers. Some of my interests include low-dimensional topology<a href="https://medium.com/@Basedmath">,</a> knot theory, topological data analysis, 
      <br> and mathematical physics. 
    
    In particular categorifications of certain classical invariants of knots and links play an increasingly important role in topology such as the various Floer homology theories, Khovanov homology, etc. <br>
  Similarly many phenomenon in "classical" physics also are upgraded into modern theories. Another viewpoint would be to understand "decategorifications" of modern physics phenomenon and their roots in classical physics. </p>
    <h2> Best Manifolds</h2>
        <h2> Best Invariants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Euler Characteristic (especially of the brain): I wrote a short python code for computing the Euler Characteristic of a graph: <a href="https://timgbates.github.io/document/EulerCharacteristicAlgo-2.pdf">HERE</a></li>
      <br> It computes the graphs's associated clique complex's Euler characteristic via Oliver Knill's discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
    </ul>

  <h3>Topological Data Analysis</h3>
  
  <p style="color:white;">
  Topological data analysis is the use of tools from topology (homology, Morse theory, cohomology, etc) to study and understand geometric features of data. 
  <br> This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04019.pdf">article</a> posted on ArXiv is a great introduction to the field from a data science perspective by Frederic Chazal and Bertrand Michel. 
  <br> There are some great resources for learning about TDA. <a href="https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s48forman.pdf">A User's guide to discrete Morse theory</a> by Robin Forman on computational Morse theory. </p>
  <br> There is also a review article by Yara Skaf and Reinhard Baubenbacher that gives an overview of TDA practices in biomedical work. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  I plan to update this section with links to some codes for TDA algorithms. At present you can find my short code for computating a generalization of the Euler characteristic (in terms of k-cliques) above. 
  <br>
  <br> Currently I am interested in the use of TDA in the field of neuroscience. How can we study topological features of brain networks?
