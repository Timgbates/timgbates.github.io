<h1>Cofinite Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a set. Let $U \subset X$ be open if $|U^c| < \infty$, that is if $U$ has a finite complement. It is easy to check that this is a well defined topology, and it posesses interesting properties depending on the size of $X$.
If $X$ is a finite set, then every subset has finite complement, and thus $(X, \mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is simply the discrete topology on $X$. 
<h1>Dictionary Order Topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$</h1>
Consider the following order on $\mathbb{R}^2$. $(x_1, y_1) \leq (x_2,y_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$ or $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$. Now endow $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the order topology given by the dictionary order. 
As a reminder, the order topology is the topology generated by the sub-base of sets of the form $(-\infty, a)$ and $(b, \infty)$ (i.e. the open rays). 

A vertical ray endowed with the subspace topology is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology; however, a horizontal line possesses the discrete topology, and thus is homeomorphic to an uncountable set endowed with the discrete topology.
