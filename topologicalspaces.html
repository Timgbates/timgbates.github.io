<h1>Cofinite Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a set. Let $U \subset X$ be open if $|U^c| < \infty$, that is if $U$ has a finite complement. It is easy to check that this is a well defined topology, and it posesses interesting properties depending on the size of $X$.
If $X$ is a finite set, then every subset has finite complement, and thus $(X, \mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is simply the discrete topology on $X$. 

Note that $(X,\mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is connected since any two nonempty open sets have nonempty intersection. Moreover, let us look at some subspaces. If we have any infinite subset $Y \subset X$ and endow it with the subspace topology, it will be connected. 
So for example $(-1, 0) \cup (1, 2)$ would be connected. However, if $|Y| < \infty$, then in fact $Y$ has the discrete topology and is totally disconnected. 


<p>This topology makes its appearance in some interesting areas. For example consider the Zariski topology on the one-dimensional affine space over $\mathbb{C}$. This is the topology generated by open sets $U_f = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f(z) \neq 0\}$, in other words,
  given a polynomial $f$, the complement of the roots of $f$ is an open set. It is clear then that the closed sets are precisely subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ which are roots of some polynomial, thus there are only finitely many elements in each closed set, thus the topology is the cofinite topology. </p>
<h1>Dictionary Order Topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$</h1>
Consider the following order on $\mathbb{R}^2$. $(x_1, y_1) \leq (x_2,y_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$ or $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$. Now endow $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the order topology given by the dictionary order. 
As a reminder, the order topology is the topology generated by the sub-base of sets of the form $(-\infty, a)$ and $(b, \infty)$ (i.e. the open rays). 

A vertical ray endowed with the subspace topology is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology; however, a horizontal line possesses the discrete topology, and thus is homeomorphic to an uncountable set endowed with the discrete topology. 

<h1>Sorgenfrey Line (Lower Limit Topology) $\mathbb{R}_{\ell}$</h1>

Consider the real line and equip it with the topology generated by half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$. 
This space is not connected as $(-\infty, a)$ and $[a, \infty)$ form two disjoint open sets whose union is the entire Sorgenfrey line. 




<h1>Earring Space</h1>
Sometimes called the Hawaiian earing, the Earring space is the following subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ endowed with the subspace topology:
$$
E = \{ (x,y) | (x-1/n)^2+y^2 = 1/n, n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

It is a classical example of a wild space. It possesses a point at $(0,0)$ where any open neighborhood is not simple connected, thus this space is not semilocally simply connected. 
It is also interesting since its fundamental group is uncountably generated. 

<h1>Cantor Set</h1>
Also refered to as the Cantor dust, due to the fact that it is nowhere-dense,  the Cantor set is constructed as follows. 

Let $E_0 = [0,1]$, and $E_1 = [0,1/3] \cup [2/3, 1]$, $E_2 = [0,1/9]\cup [2/9\cup 1/3] \cup [2/3, 7/9] \cup [8/9, 1]$, and continue inductively where $E_n$ is consists of the intervals of $E_{n-1}$ with their middle thirds removed. 
The Cantor dust is the intersection of each $E_i$. 

$$
C = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} E_n = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n
$$
It is clear that $C$ is non-empty, and in fact it is uncountable. We equip this set with the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}$. 

<h1>Moore Plane</h1>
This one will yield an example of a topological space which is separable but not second countable.
