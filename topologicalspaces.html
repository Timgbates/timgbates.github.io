This "blog" project will hopefully develop into a complete set of notes on topology with an emphasis on low dimensional manifolds and Heegaard Floer homology.

The point of this page is just to remind me that point set topology still has some neat things. 



<h1>Cofinite Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a set. Let $U \subset X$ be open if $|U^c| < \infty$, that is if $U$ has a finite complement. It is easy to check that this is a well defined topology, and it posesses interesting properties depending on the size of $X$.
If $X$ is a finite set, then every subset has finite complement, and thus $(X, \mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is simply the discrete topology on $X$. 

Note that $(X,\mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is connected since any two nonempty open sets have nonempty intersection. Moreover, let us look at some subspaces. If we have any infinite subset $Y \subset X$ and endow it with the subspace topology, it will be connected. 
So for example $(-1, 0) \cup (1, 2)$ would be connected. However, if $|Y| < \infty$, then in fact $Y$ has the discrete topology and is totally disconnected. 


<p>This topology makes its appearance in some interesting areas. For example consider the Zariski topology on the one-dimensional affine space over $\mathbb{C}$. This is the topology generated by open sets $U_f = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f(z) \neq 0\}$, in other words,
  given a polynomial $f$, the complement of the roots of $f$ is an open set. It is clear then that the closed sets are precisely subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ which are roots of some polynomial, thus there are only finitely many elements in each closed set, thus the topology is the cofinite topology. </p>
<h1>Dictionary Order Topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$</h1>
Consider the following order on $\mathbb{R}^2$. $(x_1, y_1) \leq (x_2,y_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$ or $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$. Now endow $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the order topology given by the dictionary order. 
As a reminder, the order topology is the topology generated by the sub-base of sets of the form $(-\infty, a)$ and $(b, \infty)$ (i.e. the open rays). 

A vertical ray endowed with the subspace topology is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology; however, a horizontal line possesses the discrete topology, and thus is homeomorphic to an uncountable set endowed with the discrete topology. 

<h1>Sorgenfrey Line (Lower Limit Topology) $\mathbb{R}_{\ell}$</h1>

Consider the real line and equip it with the topology generated by half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$. 
This space is not connected as $(-\infty, a)$ and $[a, \infty)$ form two disjoint open sets whose union is the entire Sorgenfrey line. 

The way I like to visualize this space is by thinking about a really really long building with a bunch of one way mirrors. Points in the real line are rooms in this building, and if I look to my left, I see an opaque wall but if I look to my right I see through a window into the next room and 
into the rooms after that. This roughly captures the idea that the generating sets are the half open intervals $[a,b)$. I'm disconnected from every other point since I can't see the points to my left, and the ones to my right have no way of seeing me. 




<h1>Earring Space</h1>
Sometimes called the Hawaiian earing, the Earring space is the following subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ endowed with the subspace topology:
$$
E = \{ (x,y) | (x-1/n)^2+y^2 = 1/n, n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

It is a classical example of a wild space. It possesses a point at $(0,0)$ where any open neighborhood is not simple connected, thus this space is not semilocally simply connected. 
It is also interesting since its fundamental group is uncountably generated. 

<h1>Cantor Set</h1>
Also refered to as the Cantor dust, due to the fact that it is nowhere-dense,  the Cantor set is constructed as follows. 

Let $E_0 = [0,1]$, and $E_1 = [0,1/3] \cup [2/3, 1]$, $E_2 = [0,1/9]\cup [2/9\cup 1/3] \cup [2/3, 7/9] \cup [8/9, 1]$, and continue inductively where $E_n$ is consists of the intervals of $E_{n-1}$ with their middle thirds removed. 
The Cantor dust is the intersection of each $E_i$. 

$$
C = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} E_n = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n
$$
It is clear that $C$ is non-empty. It is nonempty since all of the endpoints are inside $C$. All of the endpoints are countable. But in fact it is uncountable. We equip this set with the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}$. 


$C$ is also a perfect set since it contains all of its limit points. 

Ternary expansion. Choosing the 0th or second cell but never choosing the first cell is the intuition for why the Cantor set is in bijection with ternary expansions consisting of only 0s and 2s. 
This also shows that $C$ is uncountable since expansions in 0s and 2s is uncountable by a standard diagonalization argument. 


This set is also interesting properties from the point of view of analysis. Let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. $0 \leq \lambda(C) \leq \lambda(C_n) = (2/3)^n$ for all $n$ thus $\lambda(C) = 0$. 
One can also use continuity of measure since $C_0 \supseteq C_1 \supseteq C_n \supseteq \dots$ and $\lambda\left( \bigcap_{i}^{\infty} C_i\right) = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i$. 

The Cantor-Lebesgue function is a counter example to the following statement: A uniformly continuous function maps sets of measure 0 to sets o measure 0, but of course $f(C) = [0,1]$. 



<h1>Moore Plane</h1>
This one will yield an example of a topological space which is separable but not second countable. 




<h1>Hedgehog Spaces and the Paris Metric</h1>
Let us pick some cardinal number $\omega$, and let us join $\omega$ many unit intervals $[0,1]$ "spikes" at a central spoke. Formally it is the disjoint union of $\omega$ many copies of $[0,1]$ with all of the $0$'s identified.

We endow this space with a metric (called the Paris metric) where if two points $x, y$ lie in the same spoke, then $d(x,y) = |x-y|$, but if $x$ and $y$ lie in different spokes, then $d(x,y) = |x| + |y|$.  

This space is indeed a metric space and will have cardinality $\mathfrak{C} \cdot \omega$. It is clear that such a space is contractible and so has trivial homotopy and homology groups. 

<h1>Particular Point Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $p \in X$ be a particular point in that set. A set is open if it contains $p$, or is the emptyset. This forms the particular point topology on $X$. 
This topology is connected as any nonempty set must have $p$ and so the only way to find $E \cup F = X$ with $E,F$ open would be to take $E = X$ and $F = \emptyset$. 
The point $p$ also is what is called a dispersion point. A dispersion point is a point in a connected topological space, such that when I remove it the space becomes totally disconnected.
$p$ is clearly a dispersion point.

I like to visualize this topology by thinking about some guy with a lot of phones talking to a whole bunch of different people who only can talk to that guy, but as soon as this guy is removed, no one can rely information to anyone else.

It also reminds me of the quote "in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king." 



<h1>Whitehead Manifold</h1>

This is an example of an open contractible 3-manifold that is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$.
