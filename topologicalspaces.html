This "blog" project will hopefully develop into a complete set of notes on topology with an emphasis on low dimensional manifolds and Heegaard Floer homology. 

Knot Theory
===============================================================================


Algebraic Topology of the Knot Complement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
K(X) @>{ch}>> H(X;\mathbb Q);\\
@VVV @VVV \\
K(Y) @>{ch}>> H(Y;\mathbb Q);
\end{CD}$$


The exterior\footnote{Here we break slightly from the convention that 3-manifolds are denoted by $Y$. The notation $X_L$ is appropriate as we are studying the link \underline{EX}terior} is a connected compact orientable manifold with toroidal boundary, with the number of boundary components equal to the number of link components. It is clear that the homeomorphism type of $X_L$ is an invariant of the knot since any isotopy of $L$ induces a homeomorphism on $X_L$. 


__**Proposition**__
    *Let $L = \sqcup_{i=1}^n L_i$ be a $n$-component link in $S^3$, 
    $$
    \widetilde{H}_k(X_L) = \begin{cases}
        \mathbb{Z}^n \quad k = 1 \\
        \mathbb{Z}^{n-1} \quad k = 2 \\
        0 \quad \text{else}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    moreover the generators of $H_1(X_L)$ are represented by meridians $\mu_i$ of each $L_i$, moreover if $L$ is an oriented link, then the orientations $\vec{\mu_i}$ are taken to be compatible with the ``right hand rule''.*

**Definition**
    _A Seifert surface of $K$ is a connected compact orientable surface $F \subset S^3$ such that $\partial F = K$._


__Proposition__
    _Let $X_K$ be the exterior of a knot $K \hookrightarrow S^3$, then $H_2(X_k, \partial X_k) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and moreover, generators of $H_2(X_K, \partial X_K)$ correspond to Seifert surfaces of $K$ _

_Proof_
By Theorem \ref{linkhomology} it follows that 
$$
H_n(X_K) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} \quad n = 0,1 \\ 0 \quad \text{else} \end{cases}
$$
and that $\partial X_k$ is homeomorphic to a torus, thus 
$$
H_n(\partial X_K) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} \quad n = 0,2 \\ \mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z} \quad n = 1 \\ 0 \quad \text{else} \end{cases}
$$
Now consider the following long exact sequence
$$
\begin{tikzcd}[
  column sep=small,row sep=small,
  ar symbol/.style = {draw=none,"\textstyle#1" description,sloped},
  isomorphic/.style = {ar symbol={\cong}},
  ]
    \longrightarrow H_2(X_k) \arrow{r}& H_2(X_k, \partial X_k) \arrow{r}{\partial} &H_1(\partial X_k) \arrow{r}{\iota_*}& H_1(X_k) \arrow{r}{j_*}&H_1(X_k, \partial X_k) \longrightarrow\\
    0\ar[u,isomorphic] & & \mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}\ar[u,isomorphic] & \mathbb{Z} \ar[u,isomorphic]
\end{tikzcd}
$$

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
\longrightarrow H_2(X_k) @>{}>> H_2(X_k, \partial X_k) @>>> H_1(\partial X_k) ;\\
@VVV @VVV \\
K(Y) @>{ch}>> H(Y;\mathbb Q);
\end{CD}
$$

Notice that $\partial$ is injective. Since $\iota_*$ is the induced map by inclusion, we know that $\rm{im} \iota_*$ is the homology class generated by meridians of $K$, thus $\rm{im} \iota_* = [\mu] \cong \mathbb{Z}$, thus it follows that $H_2(X_k, \partial X_k) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and moreover is generated by surfaces whose boundary corresponds to longitudes of $K$, in other words, generated by Seifert surfaces $F$ of $K$.    
\end{proof}
The following proposition follows via a similar argument. 


\begin{proposition}\label{SeifertGen} \textit{Let $X_L$ be the complement of an $n$-component link $L \hookrightarrow S^3$, then $H_2(X_L, \partial X_L) \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ and generators of $H_2(X_L, \partial X_L)$ correspond to surfaces which cobound components of $L$} 
\end{proposition}



So the homology type of $X_L$ is determined by the number of components of the link. Other obvious invariants would be the homotopy groups of $X_L$, in particular the fundamental group $\pi_1(X_L)$ which is called the knot (link) group. We discuss \hyperref[compalexpolynom]{methods to compute the link} group in Appendix \ref{compalexpolynom}, but for the moment what can we say about its properties? We know that $\pi^{ab}_1(X_L) = H_1(X_L) = \mathbb{Z}^n$. Additionally, $\pi_1(X_L)$ is finitely presented. Higher homotopy groups turn out to be trivial. 

\begin{thm}
    Let $L$ be a non-split link in $S^3$, then $X_L = S^3 - L$ is a $K(\pi_1(X_L), 1)$ space. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
     If $\pi_2$ is non-trival, then by the Theorem \ref{spheretheorem} (Sphere theorem), there exists an element $[f: S^2  \rightarrow X_L] \in \pi_2(X_L)$ that admits an embedding $\Sigma$. Since this embedding misses $L$ we can also think of it as an embedding into $S^3$. By the Alexander-Sch\"onflies theorem it follows that this embedding bounds two $B^3$'s: $S^3 = B^3_1 \cup_{\Sigma} B^3_2$. Since $L$ is non-split, we may assume WLOG $L \subset B^3_1$, but then $\Sigma = \partial B^3_2$ in $S^3 - L$, thus $\Sigma$ is nullhomotopic in $X_L$, and thus $\pi_2(X_L) = 0$. Since $\overline{S^3 - L} \simeq S^3 - L$ is open, it follows from Proposition 3.29 in Hatcher\cite{hatcher} that $H_3(X_L) = 0$. Since $H_i(X_L) = 0$ for all $i \geq 2$ it follows from the Hurewicz theorem that $\pi_i(X_L) = 0$ for all $i \geq 2$.     
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
Non-split link exteriors are Haken, and in particular knot exteriors are Haken
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Seifert surfaces are compact properly embedded surfaces. If $F$ is a genus minimizing Seifert surface, then $F$ is incompressible. It remains to show that the exteriors of non-split links are prime. This follows from the fact that non-split link exteriors are irreducible since any embedded sphere $S^2 \hookrightarrow S^3 - L$ is the boundary of a $B^3$ after applying the Alexander-Sch\"onflies theorem. Since irreducible manifolds are prime, the result follows. 
\end{proof}





How strong is the homeomorphism type of $X_L$? If $L$ is a knot, then it is in fact a complete invariant! A famous theorem of Gordon and Luecke states that $X_{K_1} \cong X_{K_2}$ if and only if $K_1 \sim K_2$. 




\begin{thm}
    (Gordon-Luecke \cite{gordonluecke}) Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be knots in $S^3$, then $K_1 \sim K_2$ if and only if $X_{K_1} \cong X_{K_2}$
\end{thm}


This fails at the level of links. 


\begin{proposition}
    The 2-component link $L_n$ formed by aking $2n$-twisted knot with an unknot going through it. $L_n \neq L_m$ for $n \neq m$, however $X_{L_n} \cong X_{L_0}$ for all $n$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Consider a solid unknotted torus $V$ where the twist link $T_{2n}$ runs parallel to its core. Notice that $W= S^3 - V$ is another solid torus where the unknotted component of $L_n$ forms its core. If we consider $W  - L_n = \partial W \times [0,1) = \partial V \times [0,1)$, then applying a homeomorphism to $V$ which twists it by an $2n \pi$ rotation extends to a homeomorphism from $V - L_n$ to $V - L_n \cup W - L_n$.  Notice that this homeomorphism changes $L_{n} $ to $L_{n + m}$. Thus the link complements are homeomorphic, however the Alexander polynomial distinguishes $T_{2n}$ for all $n$, hence they do not represent the same link up to ambient isotopy. 
\end{proof}




\subsection*{$\pi_1(X_K)$: The knot group}

First let us cover the classical Wirtinger presentation of the knot group. 


Let us also recall that the 

\begin{proposition}
    $\pi_1(X_K)$ is torsion free. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $a \in \pi_1(X_K)$ has order $n$, then there is a covering space $\widetilde{X}_K$ such that $\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_K) = \mathbb{Z}_n$, but then since $X_K$ is aspherical, $\widetilde{X}_K$ is also aspherical, hence $\widetilde{X}_K$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z}_n, 1)$ space, but such a space has non-zero homology groups $H_k$ for all $k$ odd, so we see that $\widetilde{X}_K$ is not a 3-manifold. 
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
    A knot $K$ is hyperbolic if the complement of $K$ in $S^3$ admits a hyperbolic structure (a Riemannian metric with constant negative sectional curvature)
\end{definition}



3-Manifold Topology
===============================================================================



Heegaard Decompositions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handlebody theory tells us that any smooth closed orientable 3-manifold $Y$ admits a handle decomposition. 
Assuming this manifold is connected, there will be a unique 0-handle and a unique 3-handle. Since handles can be attached in ascending order we can begin with the 1-handles. 
3-dimensional one handle is a copy of $\mathbb{D}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^2$ attached to the boundary of the 0-handle along $S^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2$. There is a unique framing for the attaching map that leaves the resulting space oriented. 
After attaching the 1-handles, we are left with a space $H \cong \natural_g S^1 \times \mathbb{D}^2$. Next we need to see how the two handles are attached and since $\pi_1(O(1)) = 0$, it follows that we need only specify the isotopy class of the attaching sphere of this map. 
These can be drawn in $\partial H_1 = \Sigma_g$. As there is a unique way to attach the 3-handle, it follows that a 3-manifold can be specified by a collection of $g$ embedded curves in $\Sigma_g$. Alternatively, turning the handlebody upsidedown, the 2-handles now becoming one handles, the 3 and 2 handles form a handlebody $H'$ that is homeomorphic to $\natural_g S^1 \times \mathbb{D}^2$. It remains to glue the two pieces together along their common boundary $\Sigma_g$, i.e. $Y = H \cup_{\varphi} H'$. We could specify an element in the mapping class group of $\Sigma_g$ or we can study where the belt spheres of the handles are mapped to in $\Sigma_g$. Consider the g-handle $H$ and remove a neighborhood of the belt spheres of each 1-handle. The space we are left with is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{D}^3$. We can then attach the neighborhoods of the belt spheres to the other handlebody $H'$ by specifying an isotopy class for each belt sphere in $\Sigma_g$ and then there is a unique way to glue in the 3-ball. Doing this for both handlebodies allows us to specify the 3-manifold. 
These curves are called alpha and beta curves and they clearly satisfy: 

    + The alpha curves are pairwise disjoint 
    + Each alpha curve bounds a disk in H and each beta curve bounds a disk in H'
    + There are precisely $g$ alpha curves and $g$ beta curves


Dehn Surgery
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closely related to the previous section is a procedure known as Dehn surgery. 

__Lemma : __ _Let $Y$ be a closed oriented 3-manifold. Let $Y^0 = Y \backslash D^2 \times S^1$ for some embedded solid torus and $Y'$ the manifold obtained via $Y^0 \cup_{\varphi} D^2 \times S^1$ where $\varphi : S^1 \times S^1 \rightarrow S^1 \times S^1$, then $Y'$ is uniquely determined by where a meridian $\mu$ is mapped to via $\varphi$. _

Let $L$ be an oriented link in $S^3$. Along each component $L_i$ there is a unique isotopy class of curves in $\partial \nu(L_i)$ which has algebraic intersection 1 with $L_i$.

The point of this page is just to remind me that point set topology still has some neat things. 



<h1>Cofinite Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a set. Let $U \subset X$ be open if $|U^c| < \infty$, that is if $U$ has a finite complement. It is easy to check that this is a well defined topology, and it posesses interesting properties depending on the size of $X$.
If $X$ is a finite set, then every subset has finite complement, and thus $(X, \mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is simply the discrete topology on $X$. 

Note that $(X,\mathscr{T}_{cofin})$ is connected since any two nonempty open sets have nonempty intersection. Moreover, let us look at some subspaces. If we have any infinite subset $Y \subset X$ and endow it with the subspace topology, it will be connected. 
So for example $(-1, 0) \cup (1, 2)$ would be connected. However, if $|Y| < \infty$, then in fact $Y$ has the discrete topology and is totally disconnected. 


<p>This topology makes its appearance in some interesting areas. For example consider the Zariski topology on the one-dimensional affine space over $\mathbb{C}$. This is the topology generated by open sets $U_f = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f(z) \neq 0\}$, in other words,
  given a polynomial $f$, the complement of the roots of $f$ is an open set. It is clear then that the closed sets are precisely subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ which are roots of some polynomial, thus there are only finitely many elements in each closed set, thus the topology is the cofinite topology. </p>
<h1>Dictionary Order Topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$</h1>
Consider the following order on $\mathbb{R}^2$. $(x_1, y_1) \leq (x_2,y_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$ or $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$. Now endow $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the order topology given by the dictionary order. 
As a reminder, the order topology is the topology generated by the sub-base of sets of the form $(-\infty, a)$ and $(b, \infty)$ (i.e. the open rays). 

A vertical ray endowed with the subspace topology is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology; however, a horizontal line possesses the discrete topology, and thus is homeomorphic to an uncountable set endowed with the discrete topology. 

<h1>Sorgenfrey Line (Lower Limit Topology) $\mathbb{R}_{\ell}$</h1>

Consider the real line and equip it with the topology generated by half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$. 
This space is not connected as $(-\infty, a)$ and $[a, \infty)$ form two disjoint open sets whose union is the entire Sorgenfrey line. 

The way I like to visualize this space is by thinking about a really really long building with a bunch of one way mirrors. Points in the real line are rooms in this building, and if I look to my left, I see an opaque wall but if I look to my right I see through a window into the next room and 
into the rooms after that. This roughly captures the idea that the generating sets are the half open intervals $[a,b)$. I'm disconnected from every other point since I can't see the points to my left, and the ones to my right have no way of seeing me. 




<h1>Earring Space</h1>
Sometimes called the Hawaiian earing, the Earring space is the following subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ endowed with the subspace topology:
$$
E = \{ (x,y) | (x-1/n)^2+y^2 = 1/n, n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

It is a classical example of a wild space. It possesses a point at $(0,0)$ where any open neighborhood is not simple connected, thus this space is not semilocally simply connected. 
It is also interesting since its fundamental group is uncountably generated. 

<h1>Cantor Set</h1>
Also refered to as the Cantor dust, due to the fact that it is nowhere-dense,  the Cantor set is constructed as follows. 

Let $E_0 = [0,1]$, and $E_1 = [0,1/3] \cup [2/3, 1]$, $E_2 = [0,1/9]\cup [2/9\cup 1/3] \cup [2/3, 7/9] \cup [8/9, 1]$, and continue inductively where $E_n$ is consists of the intervals of $E_{n-1}$ with their middle thirds removed. 
The Cantor dust is the intersection of each $E_i$. 

$$
C = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} E_n = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n
$$
It is clear that $C$ is non-empty. It is nonempty since all of the endpoints are inside $C$. All of the endpoints are countable. But in fact it is uncountable. We equip this set with the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}$. 


$C$ is also a perfect set since it contains all of its limit points. 

Ternary expansion. Choosing the 0th or second cell but never choosing the first cell is the intuition for why the Cantor set is in bijection with ternary expansions consisting of only 0s and 2s. 
This also shows that $C$ is uncountable since expansions in 0s and 2s is uncountable by a standard diagonalization argument. 


This set is also interesting properties from the point of view of analysis. Let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. $0 \leq \lambda(C) \leq \lambda(C_n) = (2/3)^n$ for all $n$ thus $\lambda(C) = 0$. 
One can also use continuity of measure since $C_0 \supseteq C_1 \supseteq C_n \supseteq \dots$ and $\lambda\left( \bigcap_{i}^{\infty} C_i\right) = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^i$. 

The Cantor-Lebesgue function is a counter example to the following statement: A uniformly continuous function maps sets of measure 0 to sets o measure 0, but of course $f(C) = [0,1]$. 



<h1>Moore Plane</h1>
This one will yield an example of a topological space which is separable but not second countable. 




<h1>Hedgehog Spaces and the Paris Metric</h1>
Let us pick some cardinal number $\omega$, and let us join $\omega$ many unit intervals $[0,1]$ "spikes" at a central spoke. Formally it is the disjoint union of $\omega$ many copies of $[0,1]$ with all of the $0$'s identified.

We endow this space with a metric (called the Paris metric) where if two points $x, y$ lie in the same spoke, then $d(x,y) = |x-y|$, but if $x$ and $y$ lie in different spokes, then $d(x,y) = |x| + |y|$.  

This space is indeed a metric space and will have cardinality $\mathfrak{C} \cdot \omega$. It is clear that such a space is contractible and so has trivial homotopy and homology groups. 

<h1>Particular Point Topology</h1>
Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $p \in X$ be a particular point in that set. A set is open if it contains $p$, or is the emptyset. This forms the particular point topology on $X$. 
This topology is connected as any nonempty set must have $p$ and so the only way to find $E \cup F = X$ with $E,F$ open would be to take $E = X$ and $F = \emptyset$. 
The point $p$ also is what is called a dispersion point. A dispersion point is a point in a connected topological space, such that when I remove it the space becomes totally disconnected.
$p$ is clearly a dispersion point.

I like to visualize this topology by thinking about some guy with a lot of phones talking to a whole bunch of different people who only can talk to that guy, but as soon as this guy is removed, no one can rely information to anyone else.

It also reminds me of the quote "in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king." 



<h1>Whitehead Manifold</h1>

This is an example of an open contractible 3-manifold that is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$.
