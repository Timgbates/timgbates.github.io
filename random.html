If you're lucky enough to stumble onto this page, have fun. Here are some useless odities. 



<h2>Fibonacci Functor</h2>

Let us consider the category where the objects are natural numbers and the morphisms is the usual partial ordering on $\mathbb{N}$ (so there exists an arrow $a \rightarrow b$ if $a \leq b$). Consider the map $F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined by $n \mapsto f_n$, the nth Fibonacci number. 
One can readily check that $F$ is a functor from this category to itself.

<h2>Fibonachi Semi-Group</h2>
Let $\mathbb{N}_0$ denote the non-negative integers. Let $f(k)$ map $k$ to a sequence $F_k$ which starts with $0$, and then is followed by $k$, and then continues recursively where $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$. Notice that if $k = 1$, we have the usual Fibonacci sequence. Let's take a look at the first few examples: 
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8\\
0 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 10 & 16\\
0 & 3 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 15 & 24 
\end{array}
One notices that if I add $F_1$ to $F_2$ termwise, then I obtain $F_3$. Indeed if I consider the set of all $F_k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ I obtain a monoid under this addition of sequences. One readily notices that this monoid is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{N}_0, +)$.

Not that there's much utility in this, although you could then determine that $8 \times 3 = 24$ by looking $F_3$ and then counting to $7th$ term in the sequence. 


<h2>Some Notes on Sets and Numbers</h2>
<p>I consider myself to be a geometer (and yes that broadly includes topology in geometry which goes against the usual convention of seperating the two).
As a geometer and as a mathematician, I recognize that fundamentally we all work with sets. Recall that two sets are equivalent if and only if they contain the same elements. But I noticed that we don't actually care about sets themselves. 
We care about a set endowed with some additional structure (a topology for instance), and then we forget about the individual elements of that set, instead we are only invested in this space up to a certain equivalence. 
Indeed, we no longer care what the elements in the set are, rather how they are related to one another by the imposed geometric (or topological or algebraic) structure. 
Thus the only set theoretic invariant that remains to be interesting is the cardinality, as the number of elements will (most of the time at least) be preserved by our prefered notion of equivalence. Now there is a natural operation on sets, namely the union of two sets.
Supposing for the moment that one only deals with finite sets, this union operation then naturally induces the structure of the natural numbers on the level of cardinality. I think then that it is not so surprising that in many areas of mathematics, we should see number theory playing an important role, as it is fundamentally built into the one most important facet of sets that we care about even after imposing the additional interesting structures. 

On another note, it is also then apparent that perhaps the most natural algebraic structure is that of an Abelian monoid, in particular the monoid of non-negative integers under addition. But the other most natural algebraic structure I beleive to be groups.

  Let's see an example of what I mean. Consider the set $X = \{ a, b , c \}$ and impose the following topology $\mathscr{T} = \{ \{ a, b\}, \{ a\}, \{a,c\}, X, \emptyset\}$. 
  Now as a topological space $(X, \mathscr{T})$, I care about equivalence up to homeomorphism, that is a continuous bijection with continuous inverse. So notice that I could have taken any 3 element set and endowed it with this topology.
  However, if $Y = \{ t, g, l , d\}$ is a 4 element set, it doesn't matter what topology I equip it with, it can never be equivalent to $(X, \mathscr{T})$. Thus the cardinality plays the most important role.
