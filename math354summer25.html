Week 1: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of week one is to briefly review important concepts from linear algebra that 
will be used throughout the course. We then will set up the linear programming problem 
by converting an industrial problem into a mathematical one and then converting 
to a *standard form*. We then begin our study of this standard problem, 
its geometry, and the nature of solutions to the problem. In particular 
we show that the basic feasible solutions are the corner point feasible solutions. 

Week 2: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of week two is to introduce and understand the Simplex method. 
We will see how to make the geometric procedure of moving from corner point feasable 
solution to corner point feasible solution algorithmic (interpreting this as a change 
of basis in the basic and non basic variables). We then introduce the simplex tableau
 which is a compact way of formalizing this procedure. We study some decision problems 
 that may arise in this algorithm. What happens if there are multiple choices for entering 
 basic solutions? What do we do when we have equalities and greater than or equal 
to inequalities in our standard form problem? 

Week 3: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
In week three we continue building on the simplex method. We study some more advanced 
models. We study sensitivity analysis and marginal costs. We also investigate the run-time 
of the general simplex method and how to construct worst run time problems and why this 
is not an issue in practice. 

Week 4:
-------------------------------------------------------------
We want to finish our discussion of the simplex method by introducing the notion of duality and its 
role in LPs. We then want to begin our discussion of integer linear programming.
